    </header><p>So I started this thing recently. It&rsquo;s my little self-experiment.</p>
<p>I joined a small Korean Mastodon server. It was more of a curiosity, nothing really serious about it. But it&rsquo;s been a week already in this new place and <strong>I really like it so far!</strong></p>
<p>Only two languages allowed: <strong>English and Korean</strong>, so I&rsquo;m forced to try both. To be honest, everyone just uses Korean so I end up using mostly that language. It&rsquo;s still a bit awkward to me. I think it must be obvious that I&rsquo;m not familiar with the language and I&rsquo;m going a bit too far from what is comfortable to me. But, at the same, is quite an exciting challenge!</p>
<p>As for me: I had a period in my life where I was serious about learning this language. I had this coveted dream to go and live in some East Asian country and I picked South Korea as an interesting destination for me, so that&rsquo;s when I felt the urge to learn the language. Life then took another turn, years have passed, and I mostly lost the little I&rsquo;ve learnt during that time. But I won&rsquo;t forget the fond memories and the excitement that discovering a new culture can bring. And since then, I always wanted to go back to it.</p>
<p><strong>I just needed the <em>right</em> excuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So the excuse finally came by joining this server.</strong> I get by mostly through the translator (God bless it!), but I was amazed on how I could pick up some sentences, the things I still remember and those I still need to learn. The server is a perfect place to learn, and after a week I gotta say, <strong>I&rsquo;m learning a lot!</strong></p>
<p>What started as a joke is turning out as a very exciting experiment.</p>
<p>There are a few things that make this place work so well:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People just toot random things, and I can look and learn what people tend to say every day, rather than studying from grammar examples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By translating and repeating words and sentences, I&rsquo;m starting to see some grammatical patterns. Nothing big, but there are some things that start to get familiar (you know when something starts to sound &ldquo;right&rdquo; in your mind)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can answer to someone and there&rsquo;s a lot less pressure than 1:1 conversations. People answer to me if they want, and then they can go back to their business. There are plenty of other interesting people around, so I don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;perform&rdquo; in front of someone and keep a conversation going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just stumble upon conversations, and you don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;create&rdquo; new ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are chill and quite welcoming!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to use Korean most of the time. So there&rsquo;s no shortcut to that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s <strong>A LOT</strong> that I still don&rsquo;t understand and this thing bugs me. And this feeling of needing to know more is the best fuel to start learning again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>And that&rsquo;s what I did!</strong> I took out the old and dusty memory cards and I got back studying them. Other than getting back to learning grammar and probably, in the future, watching some shows to get back to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still kinda awkward. I still have to rely heavily on the translator (there&rsquo;s no way I can hold the same conversation in real life!) and my answers to simple questions are a guessing game most of the time. <strong>But I really like how this experiment is going!</strong></p>
